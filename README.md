# network-tsp
Experimental traveling salesman problem solver on a network (from your pals at [Arogi](http://arogi.com)).

Note to Contributors:  
Older versions of build.sh would create a redundant network-tsp directory in your local repo. If you notice such a redundant directory, make sure you have the latest iterations of the code -- and, of course, do not push the redundant directory up to GitHub.
